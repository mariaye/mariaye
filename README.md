## 👩‍💻 About Me

- 🧩 I build **mobile apps end‑to‑end**, from idea and UX to production releases.
- 💙 My **most used language is Flutter/Dart** – I love building beautiful, responsive UIs from a single codebase.
- ☕ I also ship native **Android apps in Kotlin** and **iOS apps in Swift** when a project needs that extra platform‑specific polish.
- 🚀 I enjoy clean architecture, maintainable code, and smooth developer experience.

## 🌈 What I Like to Build

- Smooth, **animation‑rich mobile experiences** that still feel fast and lightweight  
- Apps that **share a single Flutter codebase** but still feel at home on both iOS and Android  
- Native Kotlin/Swift modules for cases where you need low‑level access or platform‑specific features

## 📂 Highlighted Skills by Platform

```text
Flutter:  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐   (primary)
Kotlin:   ⭐⭐⭐⭐✩
Swift:    ⭐⭐⭐⭐✩
```

- **Flutter** for most new projects and rapid prototypes  
- **Kotlin** for Android‑native experiences or when integrating deeply with the OS  
- **Swift** for iOS‑first products and Apple‑ecosystem specific features

---

## ✨ Code Style & Principles

- Prefer **readable, self‑documenting code** over clever one‑liners  
- Consistent **state management** and clear data flow  
- Small, composable widgets / views · focus on **testability and reuse**  
- Think about **error handling, loading states, and edge cases** early
